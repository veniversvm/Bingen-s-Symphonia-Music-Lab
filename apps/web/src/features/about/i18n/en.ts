    intro:
      "This project is born from transparency and passion. As a developer and a practicing Catholic, I sought a foundation that honored both musical excellence and the spiritual dimension of art. The choice was not Saint Cecilia, but Hildegard of Bingen—a monumental figure for three powerful reasons:",

        title: "1. The First Voice with Her Own Name",
        content:
          "In the history of Western music, much of the early work is anonymous—echoes of a faceless collective devotion. Hildegard breaks this centuries-old silence. She is widely recognized by musicologists and historians as one of the first identifiable composers in history who not only signed her work but also took care to preserve and organize it. Her song cycle, 'Symphonia armonie celestium revelationum', is not just early music; it is proof that individual creativity, when combined with discipline, holds inestimable value for humanity.",

This title is bestowed upon those who have demonstrated outstanding wisdom and erudition that benefit the entire community. Her voice carries a weight of authority and teaching that resonates through the centuries. For this 'Music Lab,' her figure validates rigorous study, reminding us that music is a science of the spirit that requires both intellect and soul.",

In an era where opportunities for knowledge were severely restricted, she rose as an illustrious woman whose curiosity knew no bounds. She represents the absolute ideal of Bingen's Symphonia: a place where music theory, constant practice, technology, and art converge without conflict in a relentless pursuit of excellence.",
